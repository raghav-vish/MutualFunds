# MF
### This is a simple python script using Beautiful Soup which gets the NAV of the Mutual Funds and stores it in the excel file. 
#### To add more funds, simply add a new column in the Excel file with the name of the fund and its Moneycontrol URL.


###### Note: I have removed sensitive data from the Excel file. You can add other columns, which use the NAV for other calculations as you like. Just make sure to not channe the rows having the NAV. (Or change it in the code if you do so).
